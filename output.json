After suffering the worst nightmare of almost losing my father to Covid-19, I now had the displeasure of having him seen by Dr. Paidoussis who is filling in for our normal PCP. Instead of being sensitive and compassionate with us due to what we have been dealing with, he has been harsh and insensitive with his words making us relive the pain of what we endured again. His choice of words and demeanor have been tone-deaf to say the least. When I questioned the need for one of his medications because it was not prescribed to him when he was discharged the hospital, he bluntly and insensitively just said \u201che has Covid. He has shortness of breath. Give him the medication.\u201d This kind of demeanor with fragile patients who just experienced something so traumatic is just unacceptable.
